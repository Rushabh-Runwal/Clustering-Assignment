## Clustering Techniques

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- **Description**: Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch, using a synthetic dataset. The algorithm iteratively assigns points to the nearest centroid and updates the cluster centroids.
- **Highlights**:
  - Synthetic dataset with visualizations.
  - Evaluation metrics: SSD and Silhouette Score.

---

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
- **Description**: Explored hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) using an existing implementation. Demonstrated dendrogram plotting and linkage methods.
- **Highlights**:
  - Use of linkage types (e.g., single, complete).
  - Visualization of dendrograms for clustering insights.

---

### 3. Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering
- **Description**: Used Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering a dataset. GMM assumes data points are drawn from multiple Gaussian distributions.
- **Highlights**:
  - Compared GMM with K-Means.
  - Visualized probability distributions.

---

### 4. DBSCAN Clustering using PyCaret
- **Description**: Leveraged PyCaretâ€™s clustering module to implement DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm. Showcased its ability to handle noise and non-spherical clusters.
- **Highlights**:
  - Automatic parameter tuning.
  - Cluster quality evaluation.

---

### 5. Anomaly Detection using PyOD
- **Description**: Demonstrated anomaly detection using PyOD (Python Outlier Detection). Worked with both univariate and multivariate data.
- **Highlights**:
  - Applied Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
  - Evaluated using precision-recall metrics.

---

### 6. Time Series Clustering using Pre-Trained Models
- **Description**: Implemented clustering of time-series data using pre-trained models and embeddings. Worked with state-of-the-art libraries.
- **Highlights**:
  - Embedded time series into feature space.
  - Clustering visualization for time-series patterns.

---

### 7. Document Clustering with LLM Embeddings
- **Description**: Clustered textual data using embeddings generated by state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Sentence Transformers). Visualized the document clusters using dimensionality reduction.
- **Highlights**:
  - Used cosine similarity for clustering.
  - Real-world document dataset example.

---

### 8. Image Clustering using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
- **Description**: Performed clustering on images by leveraging embeddings from ImageBind, a powerful pre-trained model for multimodal embeddings.
- **Highlights**:
  - Visualized cluster centroids as representative images.
  - Image similarity-based clustering.

---

### 9. Audio Clustering using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
- **Description**: Clustered audio features using embeddings extracted from ImageBind. Demonstrated the grouping of similar audio samples.
- **Highlights**:
  - Audio feature extraction using pretrained models.
  - Applied clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN.
